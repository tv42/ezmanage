#Based on: Id: ezmlmrc,v 1.35 1998/03/08 03:56:34 lindberg Exp lindberg
#
# Changes from the standard version:
#  -no need to specify -x to make dir/editor have "ezmlm-reject dir"
#   => size limits work by default
#  -specify -6 dir to activate archiving to dir/YYYY/MM (needs maildrop etc)
#
#
# ezmlmrc 
# #######
# Controls the actions of ezmlm-make as patched with ezmlm-idx-0.20 or later.
#
# The base directory 'DIR' is always created by ezmlm-make, as is DIR/key.
# Everything else is done from here.
#
# ezmlm-make looks for this file, first as .ezmlmrc in the directory that the
# lists .qmail files will be placed in (if you've used the -c command line
# switch), then /etc/ezmlmrc, then ezmlmrc in the ezmlm-make binary directory.
# Thus, you can customize ezmlm-make on a global level by placing a customized
# copy of ezmlmrc in /etc and on a user level by copying it to .ezmlmrc in
# the user's home directory AND use the ezmlm-make -x switch.
#
# Tags are:
#	</filename/>       : put succeeding text lines in DIR/filename
#	</-filename/>      : erase DIR/filename.
#	</+dirname/>       : create directory DIR/dirname
#	</:lname/dirname>  : symlink DIR/.qmail-list-lname -> DIR/dirname
#
# The name in the tag can be suffixed with '#' and any number of flags,
# corresponding to command line switches. The item will be created/extended
# only if all the flags listed are set. Files can be extended as long as they
# were the last one created, but not if another file has been started since
# then. Flags that are not recognized are silently ignored.
# 
# Thus, </filename#aP/> creates the file if and only if the list is archived
# (-a) and not public (-P). If the next tag is </filename#m/>, the file is
# extended with the lines up to the next tag if the list is message moderated
# (-m). If the next tag is </another/>, 'filename' is closed. Any further
# tags leading to the reopenining of 'filename' will overwrite the file, not
# extend it.
#
# A set of user-defined command line switches (xX, yY, zZ) are available for
# customization.
#
# Within the text, certain tags are substituted. Other tags are copied as
# is. <#A#> and <#R#> are substituted by ezmlm-manage and -store (see man pages)
# and <#l#> (lower case L) is replaced dynamically by the list name for
# programs handling both 'list' and 'list-digest'.
#
# Substitutions are:
# <#B#> ezmlm binaries path   <#C#> digest code         <#D#> dir
# <#H#> host                  <#L#> local               <#F#> flags
# <#T#> dot                   <#0#> arg for -0. <#3#>...<#9#> arg for -3..9
# <#1#> ext1                  <#2#> ext2 [if dot is /path/.qmail-ext1-ext2-name]
# The latter useful when a single user is controlling several virtual domains.
#
# -0 is used for the main list address when setting up sublists
# -4 for specifying the ezmlm-tstdig switches used in dir/editor. Default
#    -k64 -m30 -t24. Only used if -g is used.
# -5 for list-owner address. Mail to list-owner will be forwarded to this addr.
# -7 for contents of DIR/modpost
# -8 for contents of DIR/modsub
# -9 for contents of DIR/remote
#
# For demonstration purposes, the '-x' switch results in the following
# non-standard actions:
# - A few references to the list owner are added to the texts.
# - DIR/headeradd is set up to add a reply-to: list@host header.
# - DIR/headerremove removes reply-to headers.
# - reply addresses for (un)sub, reject/accept have mailto:prefixes.
#
# Attempts to create links or directories that already exist, will result
# in a FATAL error. Attempts to open files that have already been closed
# or already exits, will cause the old file to be overwritten.
#
# One of the major problems with ezmlm-lists is DIR/inlocal. For normal
# users, it is set up to the list name (user-list or so), which is correct.
# However, for user 'ezmlm' in control of virtual domain 'host.dom.com'
# the list name is 'list@host.dom.com', but inlocal should be 'ezmlm-list',
# not 'list'. Similarly, if ezmlm-domain1 is in control of 'host.dom.com,
# list@host.dom.com, should yield an inlocal of 'ezmlm-domain1-list'. To
# always get the lists correct, place this file as '.ezmlmrc' in the 
# users home directory (~ezmlm/.ezmlmrc) and change the inlocal text below
# to 'ezmlm-<#L#>' or 'ezmlm-<#1#>-<#L#>, respectively.
# config to support future editing withour giving ezmlm-make command line
# arguments other than dir. Useful for GUI/WWW editing tools

Thank you for agreeing to moderate the <#L#>@<#H#>
mailing list.

My commands are a little different from many other mailing lists.
They may at first seem unusual, but as you get used to them,
you will appreciate the simplicity of the system and the speed
with which I deal with your requests.

Here are some notes about how moderation works:

Remote subscription
-------------------
As a moderator, you can subscribe and unsubscribe
john@johnhost.domain by sending mail to:

<#L#>-subscribe-john=johnhost.johndomain@<#H#>
<#L#>-unsubscribe-john=johnhost.johndomain@<#H#>

</#g/>
For the digest list:

<#L#>-digest-subscribe-john=johnhost.johndomain@<#H#>
<#L#>-digest-unsubscribe-john=johnhost.johndomain@<#H#>

<//>
That's all. No subject and no message body needed!

</#r/>
I will send you a confirmation request, to make sure
that you really sent the request. Simply reply to the
message, and the transaction is complete.
</#R/>
I will send a confirmation request to the user address.
All the user has to do is to reply to the message.
<//>

I will notify the user when his/her subscriber status
has changed.

Subscription
------------

Any user can subscribe or unsubscribe by sending mail to:

<#L#>-subscribe@<#H#>
<#L#>-unsubscribe@<#H#>

</#g/>
For the digest list:

<#L#>-digest-subscribe@<#H#>
<#L#>-digest-unsubscribe@<#H#>

The user will receive a confirmation request to make
sure s/he controls the subscription address. Once this
is verified the user is unsubscribed.

</#s/>
For subscriptions,
a second confirmation request is sent to the moderator(s).
A simple reply from the moderator will complete the transaction.
</#S/>
Subscriptions work the same way.
<//>

The user can also use:

<#L#>-subscribe-john=johnhost.johndomain@<#H#>
<#L#>-unsubscribe-john=johnhost.johndomain@<#H#>

to have mail sent to another address s/he controls.
Only if s/he receives mail at john@johnhost.johndomain
will s/he be able to reply to the confirmation request.

All this ensures that there are no fake subscriptions
and that you as a moderator can be confident that the
subscriber address is real.

Your address and identity will not be revealed to the subscriber.

</#m/>
Moderated posts
---------------
When posts are moderated, I will put posted messages into
a queue, and then send a moderation request to the moderator(s).

Just reply to the 'Reply-To:' address (this should be automatic)
if you want to accept the post.

If you want to reject it, send mail to the 'From:' address
(can usually be done be 'reply-to-all' and then deleting
your address and the accept address). You can add an
optional comment to the sender between two lines
starting with three '%'.

I will process the message according to the first reply I receive.
If you send me a request to accept a message that has already been
rejected or vice versa, I will let you know.

If I receive no moderator replies within a certain period of
time (normally 5 days), I will return the message to the sender
with an explanation of what happened.
<//>

Vacations
---------
If you are temporarily at a different address, just forward all messages
that have the correct 'Mailing-List:' header (or all that have subjects
starting with 'MODERATE for <#L#>@<#H#>'
or 'CONFIRM subscribe to <#L#>@<#H#>') to the
new address. You can then moderate from the new address. Alternatively,
you can forward the messages to a friend so that s/he can moderate
for you. Please OK this with the list owner first.

If you would like to automatically approve all requests while you
are gone, set up you mail client to auto-reply to messages that
have subjects meeting the above criteria.

</#r/>
If you try to do remote administration from an address that is not
your own, the subscriber, not you, will be asked to confirm. After
that, a moderator confirm request is sent to all moderators.
I'm doing this because I have no way of knowing that it is you that
sent the original request.

Please note that your original request (and your address) are sent to
the subscriber in this case!
<//>

Good luck!

PS: Please contact the list owner (<#L#>-owner@<#H#>) if you
have any questions or problems.

</text/mod-reject/>
I'm sorry, your message (enclosed) was not accepted by the moderator.
If the moderator has made any comments, they are shown below.
</text/mod-request/>
Please decide if you as moderator approve the enclosed message
for distribution to the <#L#> mailing list.

To approve the message and cause it to be immediately sent
to all list subscribers, please send a message to:

# This does the default !A for normal setups, but puts in a 'mailto:address'
# for lists created with the -x switch.
</#X/>
!A
</#x/>
mailto:<#A#>
# Below is a minimalist tag. It just means that succeeding lines should be
# added to the currently open file in all cases.
<//>

To reject the post and cause it to be returned to the
sender, please send a message to:

</#X/>
!R
</#x/>
mailto:<#R#>
<//>

You do not need to copy the post in your response to accept or 
reject it. If you wish to send a comment to the sender of a rejected
post, please include it between two marker lines starting with three
percent signs ('%').

%%% Start comment
%%% End comment

Oops, that confirmation number appears to be invalid.

The most common reason for invalid numbers is expiration. I have to

header for:

'Return-Path: <<#l#>-return-1234-user=host.dom@<#H#>>'

The unsubscribe address for this user would be:
'<#l#>-unsubscribe-user=host.dom@<#H#>'.
Just mail to that address, substituting user=host.dom for the real
values, reply to the confirmation request, and you should receive a message
that you're off the list.

If this still doesn't work, I'm sorry to say that I can't help you.
Please FORWARD a list message together with a note about what you're
trying to achieve to my owner:

</#x/>
mailto:<#L#>-owner@<#H#>
</#X/>
    <#l#>-owner@<#H#>
<//>

who will take care of it. My owner is a little bit slower than I am, 
so please be patient.
